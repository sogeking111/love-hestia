            Love Hestia began in 2022, born from healing, hope, and a renewed
            sense of purpose. Like many, the journey was shaped by the
            uncertainty of the pandemic. In the quiet stillness that followed,
            dried flowers became a new source of comfort and creativity. With no
            background in floral design, the very first bouquet I created was
            sold right away. That small moment sparked something much bigger, a
            path that felt unexpected but meant to be.
            <br />
            <br />
            What started as a small, comforting hobby slowly grew into a passion
            and eventually a business. From offering locally sourced dried
            flowers, Love Hestia has expanded into creating premium preserved
            blooms that can last 1-2 years with proper care. Every arrangement
            is crafted with intention, care, and heart, perfect for gifting or
            adding warmth to any space.
            <br />
            <br />
            Today, Love Hestia also offers dried flower workshops, teaching
            others how to create pieces they can proudly take home. Through
            every bouquet and every workshop, the mission remains the same: to
            share joy, creativity, and a little warmth, one flower at a time.
